## Introduction

This project leverages a logistic regression model to perform binary classification on images. The primary objective is to determine if an image contains a cat. Logistic regression, although simple, is a powerful statistical model that is effective for this binary classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images labeled as either "cat" or "not cat." The images are preprocessed to a fixed size and converted to grayscale to simplify the computational complexity.

## Model

The logistic regression model is implemented using the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Resize images, standardize pixel values.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Flatten images into 1D arrays to serve as input features.
3. **Training:** Use gradient descent to optimize the logistic regression cost function.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy.

## Installation

To run the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SegunDada/logistic-regression-image-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd logistic-regression-image-classification
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To classify an image using the trained logistic regression model:

1. Ensure the image is in the `image/` directory.
2. Edit line 30 of the code to include your image name. The code will preprocess your image to fit the model.
3. The output will display whether the image is classified as "cat" or "not cat."

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 70% on the test dataset. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the main juypter note file.
